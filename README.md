# HA_Kobo
Kobo Touch N905B running as Home Assistant Daskboard

1. Prevent direct internet access because otherwise Kobo is pushing new firmware
I removed my router from internet, booted Kobo and gave it Wifi access. Then gave it fixed IP and blocked it from internet. Then connected router back. Kobo now has access only in my home network. ( Do not plug the internet before you are certain Kobo is blocked from it) 

2. Install KoboWM image

Image file: https://www.dropbox.com/s/2hql5f651xhz8cx/kobowm.zip?dl=1
Github: https://github.com/pasqu4le/kobowm
At first, take backup from your current internal Kobo SD card. 
Open KoboWM image with hex editor like HxD and copy the part 000080000 - 00008006F from your Kobo image to KoboWM image. That part tells what kind of hardware your Kobo has. 
KoboWM image was created for N905C but it works with other versions, like my B905B, when that part is copied. 
Write new image to SD. 

3. Setting wifi
√ùou can't set wifi if you don't have internet access. Because Kobo wants to have access to it's site. 
So I mounted SD to my PC via usb reader, started Ubuntu in Virtualbox, mounted USB reader and mounted the disks. 
Edit the file /debian/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf

ctrl_interface=/var/run/wpa_supplicant
update_config=1

network={
        ssid="MyWifi"
        psk="MyWifiPassword"
}

Of course, change MyWifi and MyWifiPassword
You can hash to password with 
wpa_passphrase YOUR_SSID YOUR_PASSWORD
and add the result without quotes to psk. 

4. Boot Kobo and select KoboWM from start screen.
Press wifi button and you should have working Wifi and SSH. 
User is marek, password abc123 by default.

5. Setting up proxy http server
Because Kobo does not have direct internet access, you set up http proxy in another server
I used Privoxy. 
vi /etc/privoxy/config
listen-address  your_proxy:8118
your_proxy is the ip of the server you installed Privoxy. You can test if the proxy works with for instance Firefox. 

5. Update repositories
Repositories are now archived, so update file 
vi /etc/apt/sources.list
deb http://archive.debian.org/debian/ jessie main non-free contrib
#deb http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian jessie main

Update the repositories through proxy:
http_proxy=http://your_proxy:8118 apt-get update

Now you can update and install software 
http_proxy=http://your_proxy:8118 apt-get install sofware-package
or with pip/pip3
pip3 --proxy your_proxy:8118 install paho-mqtt

( You could also set http_proxy in .profile but I'm paranoid and don't want any other software to use proxy ) 

6. Updating the clock
My Kobo's clock returns always back to year 2011 when rebooted, and NTP only works when Wifi is on 

At first I set the right timezone
sudo ln -s /usr/share/zoneinfo/Europe/Helsinki /etc/localtime

Install ntpdate
http_proxy=http://your_proxy:8118 apt-get install ntpdate

I can use my home automation server as time server.
sudo ntpdate homeautomation
This should update datetime manually. Every linux running NTP can be used as time server. 
I allow my network user my home automation server as NTP server by setting in it's ntp.conf 
restrict 192.168.1.0 mask 255.255.255.0

Set it to run every time wifi is started. 
vi /home/marek/scripts/wifi/start
end of file: 
    python /home/marek/kobowm/notifzmq.py "Wifi" "IP: $(sudo ifconfig eth0 | grep -o -E '([0-9]{1,3}\.){3}[0-9]{1,3}' | head -1)" 5000
    sudo ntpdate your_ntp_server  <-- insert this with your NTP server
    exit

7. Install HA_Kobo
copy HA_Kobo directory under /home/marek

Install apt&python packages
http_proxy=http://your_proxy:8118 apt-get install python3-tk
pip3 --proxy your_proxy:8118 install paho-mqtt

( you might need some more so sorry...)

Test run: 
cd /home/marek/HA_Kobo
python3 HA_Kobo.py

Because you have no data in MQTT yet, only decent data you get is datetimes. 

Always close the program with KoboWMs button X !

8. Integrate HA_Kobo to KoboWM

We'll hijack the sdcard button for HA_Kobo

mv /home/marek/scripts/sdcard/toggle /home/marek/scripts/sdcard/toggle.old
cp /home/marek/HA_Kobo/sdcard_toggle /home/marek/scripts/sdcard/toggle
chmod 755 /home/marek/scripts/sdcard/toggle

mv /home/marek/kobowm/icons/media-floppy-symbolic.symbolic.png /home/marek/kobowm/icons/media-floppy-symbolic.symbolic.png.old
cp /home/marek/HA_Kobo/ha_icon.png /home/marek/kobowm/icons/media-floppy-symbolic.symbolic.png

Now reboot and you'll have new HA button to start HA_Kobo.
